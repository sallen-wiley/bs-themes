# bs-themes
bootstrap themes repo

A collection of themes based on the bootstrap framework for Wiley products.

The stack was put together using [a guide from Paul Wolf](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/create-your-bootstrap-theme-4228aca9117a) 

The themes are primarily for the purpose of integrating into [Bootstrap Studio](https://bootstrapstudio.io/), but can be used for anything else.
